easel
-----

Easel is about making it easy to create your own vim color scheme. It consists of:

* A set of source files in different languages to try out your color scheme.
* Functions and associated keybindings that come in useful when working on your colorscheme
* A dark canvas scheme to base your own color scheme on.


How to use
----------

1. Clone this repo.
2. Copy the dark_canvas directory out and rename it with whatever name you want to use for your color scheme
3. Also rename the file that is in the colors directory and change the name in the line: `let colors_name
   = "dark_canvas"`
4. Open one of the files in the test_subjects directory, open your color scheme, and source easel.vim from the plugin
   directory.
